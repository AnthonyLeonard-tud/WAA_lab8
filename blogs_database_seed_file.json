We’ve replaced a site hosted on our datacentres with a new one, designed and built for the cloud. Most of the tools and systems that power the site have moved too. We’ve used modern approaches and technologies, like serverless. And we’ve refreshed the design, approach, and editorial workflow, ready for the future. Hundreds of people have been involved, over several years. And it’s just about complete.",
